# IET_ITS_InstantDeliveryRoutingOptimizationWithOrderAllocationStrategyBasedOnTransferStatioN

We provide the original file of the test instances in the attachment file “test instances.zip”. This attachment contains three files, of which “test_instances_50.csv” and “test_instances_100.csv” are instances used in this paper. “readme.txt” is a description of the content and format of the instances. We also public our instances on here.

We provide the original file of algorithm code in the attachment file “Algorithm code.zip”. This attachment contains two folders,
of which “DBSCAN” and “ALNS” contain the corresponding code of the algorithm used in this paper and the corresponding input files.

In folder “DBSCAN”, “DBSCAN.py” can read the instances, 
then cluster them, and create a new file to write the clustering results. 
“normal_orders_test_instances_50.csv” and “normal_orders_test_instances_100.csv” are input files, which contain the normal orders of corresponding instances.


In folder “ALNS”, the code of ALNS is in “ALNS.zip” and is implemented in java programming language. 
A description of the code is written in the “readme.txt” file. The input file of the algorithm is put in the folder “INPUT”. 
And there is also a “readme.txt” to describe the input files in details.
